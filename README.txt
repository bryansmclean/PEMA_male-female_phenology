# This repository contains data and code corresponding to a study of breeding phenology in the North American deer mouse, currently in review at Ecosphere.
# It also contains data from a previous study (McLean BS, Guralnick RP. 2021. Digital biodiversity data sets reveal breeding phenology and its drivers in a widespread North American mammal. Ecology 102(3):e03258)

# DATA SETS
PEMA_male_data.csv - male reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in the Ecosphere paper
PEMA_phenology_final_dataframe.csv - female reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in McLean and Guralnick (2021)

# R CODE
R code used in the male paper, largely hierarchical GAMs and generalized linear mixed models, model comparison, and plotting
