# It also contains data from a previous study (McLean BS, Guralnick RP. 2021. Digital biodiversity data sets reveal breeding phenology and its drivers in a widespread North American mammal. Ecology 102(3):e03258)

# DATA SETS
male_data_ClimNA.csv	- male reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in the Ecosphere paper
phen.final.data.csv	- female reproductive traits, body size, and associated climate variables used in McLean and Guralnick (2021)

# CODE
R code used in the male paper, largely for hierarchical GAMs and generalized linear mixed models
